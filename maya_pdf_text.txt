MAYA
 
(TWITTER
 
ASSISTANT)
 
 
This
 
n8n
 
agent,
 
named
 
"Mega
 
X
 
Agent,"
 
acts
 
as
 
a
 
Twitter
 
Assistant
 
called
 
Maya.
 
Its
 
primary
 
function
 
is
 
to
 
manage
 
and
 
grow
 
a
 
professional
 
Twitter
 
account,
 
specifically
 
focusing
 
on
 
cybersecurity
 
content
.
 
Maya
 
delegates
 
tasks
 
to
 
several
 
specialized
 
tools
 
to
 
achieve
 
this:
 
 
How
 
the
 
Mega
 
X
 
Agent
 
Works
 
The
 
agent
 
is
 
triggered
 
by
 
Slack
 
mentions
,
 
meaning
 
it
 
starts
 
working
 
when
 
someone
 
mentions
 
it
 
on
 
a
 
designated
 
Slack
 
channel.
 
Here's
 
a
 
breakdown
 
of
 
its
 
workflow:
 
●
 
Brain
 
(AI
 
Agent
 
&
 
Google
 
Gemini
 
Chat
 
Model):
 
The
 
"AI
 
Agent"
 
node,
 
powered
 
by
 
the
 
"Google
 
Gemini
 
Chat
 
Model,"
 
is
 
the
 
core
 
intelligence.
 
It
 
processes
 
incoming
 
requests
 
from
 
Slack
 
and
 
decides
 
which
 
tool
 
to
 
use
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
user's
 
intent.
 
It
 
also
 
leverages
 
"Postgres
 
Chat
 
Memory"
 
to
 
remember
 
past
 
conversations
 
and
 
maintain
 
context.
 
 
●
 
Tool
 
Delegation:
 
Maya
 
(the
 
AI
 
Agent)
 
has
 
access
 
to
 
four
 
key
 
tools:
 
1.
 
Topic
 
Finder:
 
This
 
tool
 
is
 
used
 
exclusively
 
to
 
identify
 
trending
 
and
 
relevant
 
tweet
 
topics
 
related
 
to
 
cybersecurity
,
 
drawing
 
from
 
trending
 
tweets
 
and
 
news.
 
2.
 
Tweeting:
 
Once
 
a
 
topic
 
is
 
approved
 
by
 
the
 
user,
 
this
 
tool
 
is
 
responsible
 
for
 
drafting
 
and
 
posting
 
insightful
 
and
 
engaging
 
tweets
.
 
The
 
agent
 
will
 
always
 
seek
 
user
 
approval
 
before
 
posting.
 
3.
 
Reply:
 
This
 
tool
 
is
 
used
 
to
 
fetch
 
trending
 
cybersecurity
 
tweets,
 
show
 
them
 
to
 
the
 
user,
 
and
 
then
 
craft
 
thoughtful
 
replies
 
to
 
those
 
tweets.
 
It
 
also
 
fetches
 
the
 
tweet
 
ID,
 
which
 
is
 
crucial
 
for
 
replying.
 
User
 
approval
 
is
 
required
 
before
 
posting
 
any
 
replies.
 
4.
 
Engagement
 
Metrics:
 
This
 
tool
 
allows
 
Maya
 
to
 
evaluate
 
the
 
performance
 
of
 
previous
 
tweets
,
 
providing
 
data
 
to
 
optimize
 
future
 
content
 
strategy.
 
 
●
 
Communication
 
(Slack
 
Integration):
 
After
 
processing
 
a
 
request
 
and
 
interacting
 
with
 
its
 
tools,
 
the
 
"AI
 
Agent"
 
sends
 
its
 
output
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
user
 
via
 
the
 
"Send
 
a
 
message"
 
node,
 
which
 
posts
 
the
 
response
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
specified
 
Slack
 
channel.
 
 
Key
 
Operational
 
Guidelines:
 
●
 
Simple
 
Language:
 
The
 
agent
 
communicates
 
in
 
simple,
 
conversational
 
English,
 
avoiding
 
jargon
 
unless
 
necessary
 
for
 
a
 
technical
 
audience.
 
●
 
Originality
 
and
 
Consistency:
 
It
 
prioritizes
 
original,
 
authentic
 
content
 
and
 
maintains
 
a
 
consistent
 
brand
 
tone.

will
 
always
 
seek
 
approval
 
from
 
the
 
user
 
before
 
taking

In
 
essence,
 
the
 
Mega
 
X
 
Agent
 
streamlines
 
Twitter
 
account
 
management
 
for
 
cybersecurity
 
content
 
by

How
 
it
 
Works:
 
1.
 
Trigger:
 
The
 
workflow
 
is
 
initiated
 
when
 
it's
 
called
 
by
 
another
 
workflow
 
(likely
 
the
 
main
 
"Mega
 
X
 
Agent")
 
with
 
a
 
query
 
from
 
the
 
user.
 
The
 
user's
 
query
 
will
 
specify
 
what
 
engagement
 
metrics
 
they
 
are
 
interested
 
in.
 
2.
 
AI
 
Agent
 
(Brain):
 
The
 
"AI
 
Agent,"
 
powered
 
by
 
the
 
"Google
 
Gemini
 
Chat
 
Model,"
 
serves
 
as
 
the
 
central
 
intelligence
 
of
 
this
 
workflow.
 
Its
 
main
 
responsibilities
 
are:
 
○
 
Understanding
 
User
 
Queries:
 
It
 
interprets
 
the
 
user's
 
request
 
for
 
engagement
 
metrics.
 
○
 
Data
 
Retrieval:
 
It
 
uses
 
its
 
access
 
to
 
the
 
"Engagement
 
Metrics
 
Sheet"
 
tool
 
to
 
fetch
 
the
 
requested
 
information.
 
○

Provision:
 
It
 
presents
 
the
 
retrieved
 
engagement
 
metrics
 
to
 
the
 
user
 
in
 
a
 
helpful
 
and
 
understandable

This
 
is
 
the

It's
 
a
 
Google

that
 
stores
 
detailed

is
 
explicitly
 
stated
 
to
 
contain
 
the
 
following
 
columns:
 ---PAGE BREAK---■
 
ID:
 
The
 
unique

○
 
Google

This
 
is
 
the
 
large
 
language
 
model
 
that
 
drives
 
the
 
AI
 
Agent's
 
ability
 
to
 
understand
 
natural

queries
 
and
 
formulate
 
responses.
 
○
 
Simple
 
Memory:
 
This
 
node
 
helps
 
the
 
AI
 
Agent
 
maintain
 
context
 
throughout
 
the
 
conversation
 
with
 
the
 
user,
 
allowing
 
for
 
more
 
fluid
 
and
 
coherent
 
interactions,
 
especially
 
when
 
discussing
 
multiple
 
tweets
 
or
 
metrics.
 
○
 
When
 
Executed
 
by
 
Another
 
Workflow:
 
This
 
node
 
acts
 
as
 
the
 
entry
 
point,
 
allowing
 
the
 
"X

to
 
be
 
called
 
and
 
integrated
 
into
 
a
 
larger
 
system
 
(the
 
"Mega

Key
 
Operational
 
Rule:
 
●
 
Data
 
Provision:
 
The
 
AI
 
Agent's
 
primary
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
provide
 
the
 
user
 
with
 
the
 
requested
 
engagement
 
metrics
 
from
 
the
 
"Engagement

It
 
acts
 
as
 
an
 
information

system
 
for
 
historical
 
tweet
 
performance.
 
In
 
essence,
 
the
 
"X
 
Engagement
 
Metrics"
 
tool
 
acts
 
as
 
a
 
dedicated
 
analytics
 
reporting
 
system
 
for
 
tweets.
 
It
 
allows
 
a
 
user
 
to
 
query
 
historical
 
performance
 
data
 
for
 
their
 
tweets,
 
providing
 
insights
 
into
 
their

 ---PAGE BREAK---Tweet
 
Analyser
 
.
 
This
 
n8n
 
workflow,
 
named
 
"Tweets
 
Analyser,"
 
is
 
an
 
automated
 
system
 
designed
 
to
 
periodically
 
fetch
 
and
 
store
 
engagement
 
metrics
 
for
 
tweets
 
in
 
a
 
Google
 
Sheet.
 
The
 
data
 
stored
 
by
 
this
 
tool
 
is
 
available
 
through
 
Maya
 
 
How
 
it
 
Works:
 
1.
 
Trigger
 
("Google
 
Sheets
 
Trigger"):
 
This
 
workflow
 
is
 
set
 
to
 
trigger
 
every
 
minute
.
 
It
 
monitors
 
a
 
specific
 
Google
 
Sheet
 
.
 
It
 
seems
 
to
 
be
 
looking
 
for
 
new
 
rows
 
or
 
changes
 
in
 
this
 
sheet,
 
specifically
 
expecting
 
"Tweet
 
ID"
 
values
 
to
 
be
 
present.
 
2.
 
Wait:
 
After
 
being
 
triggered,
 
the
 
workflow
 
introduces
 
a
 
24-hour
 
delay
 
using
 
the
 
"Wait"
 
node.
 
This
 
suggests
 
that
 
the
 
engagement
 
metrics
 
for
 
a
 
tweet
 
are
 
collected
 
one
 
day
 
after
 
the
 
tweet's
 
ID
 
appears
 
in
 
the
 
trigger
 
sheet,
 
allowing
 
time
 
for
 
initial
 
engagement
 
to
 
accumulate.
 
3.
 
HTTP
 
Request
 
("Get
 
Tweet
 
Data"):
 
After
 
the
 
24-hour
 
wait,
 
this
 
node
 
makes
 
an
 
API
 
call
 
to
 
a
 
Twitter
 
API
 
endpoint
 
(
https://api.twitterapi.io/twitter/tweets
).
 
○
 
It
 
uses
 
the
 
tweet_ids
 
query
 
parameter,
 
taking
 
the
 
"Tweet
 
ID"
 
directly
 
from
 
the
 
data
 
that
 
triggered
 
the
 
workflow
 
(e.g.,
 
the
 
new
 
row
 
in
 
"Sheet1").
 
○
 
The
 
purpose
 
of
 
this
 
call
 
is
 
to
 
fetch
 
the
 
current,
 
real-time
 
engagement
 
metrics
 
for
 
the
 
specified
 
tweet(s).
 
4.
 
Append
 
row
 
in
 
sheet
 
("Store
 
Engagement
 
Metrics"):
 
The
 
final
 
step
 
is
 
to
 
append
 
a
 
new
 
row
 
to
 
another
 
Google
 
Sheet
 
(specifically
 
"Sheet3"
 
of
 
the
 
"Twitter
 
Agent"
 
spreadsheet,
 
1btnAsLtaNminq-eXzc_jkYInpXeaq9ZoBwNAPfMA4Ic
).
 
This
 
sheet
 
is
 
likely
 
the
 
"Engagement
 
Metrics
 
Sheet"
 
referred
 
to
 
by
 
the
 
"X
 
Engagement
 
Metrics"
 
tool.
 
○
 
It
 
populates
 
the
 
columns
 
of
 
this
 
sheet
 
with
 
the
 
data
 
retrieved
 
from
 
the

Note:
 
There

here.
